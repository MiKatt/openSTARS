## Error when running the examples
**_Problem_** Error message in R console: 

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide', message = FALSE}
library(rgrass7)
library(openSTARS)

if(.Platform$OS.type == "windows"){
    gisbase = "c:/Program Files/GRASS GIS 7.2.0"
    } else {
    gisbase = "/usr/lib/grass72/"
    }
  initGRASS(gisBase = gisbase,
      home = tempdir(),
      override = TRUE)

  # Load files into GRASS
  dem_path <- system.file("extdata", "nc", "elev_ned_30m.tif", package = "openSTARS")
  sites_path <- system.file("extdata", "nc", "sites_nc.shp", package = "openSTARS")
  setup_grass_environment(dem = dem_path, sites = sites_path)
```


```{r id, error = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
import_data(dem = dem_path, sites = sites_path)
```

**_Solution_** There are three ways to fix this issue:

(a) Install openSTARS from github
```{r install_gh, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MiKatt/openSTARS")
```

(b) Download a fixed version of the example shape file for 
monitoring sites ('sites_nc') from <https://github.com/MiKatt/openSTARS/tree/master/inst/extdata/nc> 
and place them into the library folder ('.../openSTARS/extdata/nc/').

(c) Open sites_nc.shp from the library folder in a GIS program (e.g. QGIS, GRASS
might not work), open the attributes table, sort the 'value' column and start 
editing. Replace all empty cells with an arbitrary integer value. Save and close.

## Special settings for MAC OS
GRASS 7 does not run on Mac with system integrity check (<http://grassmac.wikidot.com>) and it needs to be disbaled. Additionally, GRASS addons (r.hydrodem etc.) need to be installed system-wide (see below how to install them using GRASS GUI).


## Errors and warnings on WINDOWS systems
Most problems occur because GRASS, which is called by the openSTARS package functions via package rgrass7, cannot find certain files, i.e. because some path and system variables are not set. The easiest solution is to install a stand-alone version of GRASS, i.e. not within QGIS or OSGeo.

### Setting PATH and SYSTEM variables
Alternatively, the following PATH and system variables must be set correctly (examples below assume that GRASS was installed under QGIS). This can be done globally (see instructions in the internet how to set such variables in your specific Windows version) or temporarily in the R session as follows

*	Path to iconv.dll and other necessary *.dll files; this must be set before the initGRASS command: 
Sys.setenv(PATH = paste0("C:/Program Files/QGIS 2.18/bin", ";", Sys.getenv("PATH")))
*	System variable GRASS_PYTHON; this must be set after initGRASS:
Sys.setenv(GRASS_PYTHON="C:/Program Files/QGIS 2.18/bin/python.exe")
*	System variable PYTHONHOME; this must be set after initGRASS:
Sys.setenv(PYTHONHOME="C:/Program Files/QGIS 2.18/apps/Python27")
*	System variable GDAL_DATA; this must be set after initGRASS:
Sys.setenv(GDAL_DATA="C:/Program Files/QGIS 2.18/share/gdal")

```{r windows settings, eval = FALSE}
  # GRASS in QGIS installation
  #set Path; must be done BEFORE initGRASS
  Sys.setenv(PATH=paste0("C:/Program Files/QGIS 2.18/bin",";", Sys.getenv("PATH")))
  initGRASS(gisBase = "c:/Program Files/QGIS 2.18/apps/grass/grass-7.0.5", 
            home = tempdir(),
            gisDbase = "C:/GRASSDB"
           )
  # set System Variables; must be done AFTER initGRASS
  Sys.setenv(GRASS_PYTHON="C:/Program Files/QGIS 2.18/bin/python.exe")
  Sys.setenv(PYTHONHOME="C:/Program Files/QGIS 2.18/apps/Python27")
  Sys.setenv(GDAL_DATA="C:/Program Files/QGIS 2.18/share/gdal")
```

### Specific messages
**_Problem_** Popup window:

*The program can't start because iconv.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.*
And similar messages for other \*.dll files.

**_Solution_** Check, if the missing file(s) are somewhere ‘close’ to the GRASS installation; e.g., if Grass was installed with QGIS, GRASS might be located under C:\Program Files\QGIS 2.18\apps\grass\grass-7.0.5\ and iconv.dll can be found in C:\Program Files\QGIS 2.18\bin. Set the PATH variable to the latter folder. (See instructions in the internet how to set the PATH variable in your specific Windows version.)

If this does not help, try a stand-alone installation of GRASS (<https://grass.osgeo.org/>). The missing dll files will then probably be located in a folder called 'extrabin' within the GRASS directory and will be found automatically.

## Message when using `setup_grass_environment` or `import_data`
Warning in R console: *WARNING: Over-riding projection check. Windows does not recognize the projection of the DEM raster. It will be overwritten with the one of the observation sites (* your working directory *). Please verify that the projections match.*

GRASS usually checks if all files that are imported into a mapset have the same projection. However, under Windows, this check would always results in an error. Therefore, the check is disabled under Windows and the user is asked to make sure that all sources come from the same projection manually (e.g. using another GIS).

## Messages you do not need to worry about
In the R console when using function `setup_grass_environment`:

```
Trying to open with OGR… 
...succeeded.
Default region was updated to the new projection, but if you have multiple
mapsets `g.region -d` should be run in each to update the region from the
default
Projection information updated
```

It is the intention of this function is to update the projection.

\ 

In the R console when using function `correct_compl_junctions`:
```
WARNING: XX points found, but not requested to be exported. Verify 'type' parameter.
```

In this function, the streams are imported and exported during the processing. At one stage, only the lines are exported but no points. These points were created automatically when extracting the streams from the DEM but are not needed.

\ 

In various functions:
```
WARNING: Vector map <XX> already exists and will be overwritten
WARNING: Raster map <XX> already exists and will be overwritten
```

This happens if e.g. the function has already been executed in the same GRASS locations. Existing maps are overwritten and all changes that might have been conducted are lost. However, usually this is not a problem and everything can be reconstructed if needed by just executing all functions again. If maps  are manually changed they could be saved under a different name to prevent automatic overwriting.

\ 

In the R console when using function `calc_edges`:
```
WARNING: No features selected, nothing to edit
```

In this function, points that were created automatically when extracting the streams from the DEM but are not needed are deleted. This warning appears if `correct_compl_junctions` has been executed before and the points have already been deleted.

\ 

In the R console when using function `calc_sites`:
```
WARNING: Width for column XX set to 255 (was not specified by OGR), some strings may be truncated!
```
Or in `export_ssn`:
```
Warning 1: Field site_id of width 255 truncated to 254.
```

This message appears when maps are exported to ESRI shape files, which cannot handle attribute fields with more than 254 characters. Typically, there is no need to worry because all fields should be shorter anyway. If the original shape files contained large fields with e.g. notes or other text, they may be truncated in the exported files.
